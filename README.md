# Getting Started with Create React App

## Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This app was made to demonstrate a weather application which uses accuweather APIs.\
On load, it searches and displays the weather for one of the top 50 cities in the world.\
Use the input to type a location to search the weather of a city.\
Click the icon next to the input to get your location and display the weather!\

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `REACT_APP_ACCU_API_KEY=YOUR_ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
